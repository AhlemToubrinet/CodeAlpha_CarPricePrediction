# CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction: Car Price Prediction using Linear and Lasso Regression

## üöó Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict **used car prices** based on key vehicle features such as present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. Developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**, this task focuses on the complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is the [Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars) from Kaggle.

It contains various attributes of used cars, including:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of purchase
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price (in Lakhs)
- `Kms_Driven`: Distance completed in kilometers
- `Fuel_Type`: Petrol, Diesel, or CNG
- `Selling_type`: Dealer or Individual
- `Transmission`: Manual or Automatic
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
- `Selling_Price`: Target variable (price at which the car is sold)
